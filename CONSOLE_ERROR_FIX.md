# Fix for Console Error: "User profile fetch error: {}"

## Issue
The console was showing an empty error object `{}` when trying to fetch user profiles. This happens when:
1. A user successfully authenticates with Supabase Auth
2. But doesn't have a corresponding profile record in the `users` table
3. Supabase returns an empty error object instead of `null` for "not found" cases

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `lib/supabase-client.ts`
- Added `isRealError()` utility function to check if an error object has meaningful content
- This helps distinguish between real errors and empty "not found" responses

### 2. Updated `contexts/auth-context.tsx`
- Improved error handling in `fetchUserProfile()` function
- Only logs errors that have meaningful content (message, code, details)
- When no user profile is found, creates a fallback user from auth data
- Automatically attempts to create a user profile record in the database
- More graceful handling of missing user profiles

### 3. Updated `components/auth/create-user-modal.tsx`
- Updated to use the auth context and `createClientComponentClient`
- Improved session creation for mock users
- Added `refreshUser()` call after successful user creation

### 4. Updated `components/auth/login-form.tsx`
- Increased redirect delay to allow more time for user profile fetching
- Better session validation

## How It Works Now

1. **User logs in successfully** → Session is created
2. **System tries to fetch user profile** → May get empty error if profile doesn't exist
3. **System detects empty error** → Uses `isRealError()` to identify this isn't a real error
4. **System creates fallback user** → Uses auth user data as fallback
5. **System attempts to create profile** → Tries to insert user profile into database
6. **User can proceed normally** → No more console errors, smooth authentication flow

## Benefits

- ✅ **No more empty error logs** - Only meaningful errors are logged
- ✅ **Automatic profile creation** - Missing user profiles are created automatically
- ✅ **Better user experience** - Users don't get stuck due to missing profiles
- ✅ **Graceful fallbacks** - System continues working even if database operations fail
- ✅ **Development friendly** - Clear logging for real issues, noise-free console

The system now handles the common case where users exist in Supabase Auth but don't have profiles in the custom `users` table, which is typical during development or when users are created through different flows.
